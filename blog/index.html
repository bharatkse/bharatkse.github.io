<div class="blog-intro">
  <p>
    This blog contains my notes and write-ups on
    <strong>backend architecture, system design, cloud-native engineering</strong>,
    and lessons learned from building and operating production systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    I focus on practical topics such as event-driven workflows, API design,
    reliability, security, and real-world trade-offs — not just tutorials.
